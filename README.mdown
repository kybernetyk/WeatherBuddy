Weather Buddy arduino thermometer hack
======================================

What's this?
------------

This is a little hack to the wonderful Weather Buddy app. Instead of using a online weather service to get the current temperature this version uses an arduino powered thermometer connected over the serial port to get temperature.

Requirements?
-------------
OS X baby. And a serial device that gives you the room temperature :P

Compile with Xcode 3.1+
